**ARP (Address Resolution Protocol)**




Residual Risk
- What risk is left after making a security change.

Auditing
- Checking to see if our security procedures are following the best practices.

Defense-in-depth
- Even if the door is not locked, the alarm should be on.
- Making sure that even if one thing fails (Not locking a door), there are extra defenses to make sure that the attacker can't get access to that. (Boxes in boxes)
